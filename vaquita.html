<h1>The Vaquita</h1>

</header>

<h3>What is the vaquita?</h3>

<p>A vaquita is the world’s rarest marine mammal. Also known scientifically as the Phocoena Sinus, the vaquita is a small porpoise species with only an estimated number of 10 individuals left in the wild. The vaquita is about 5 feet long with black patches around some of their facial features. They have the smallest geographical territory of any marine mammal, only living in the northern part of the Gulf of California, located in Mexico. This area is approximately 1,519 square miles, which is less than one fourth of the size of Los Angeles. The vaquita, when in a safe environment, has a known lifespan of at least 21 years. With a lifespan this long, they could make a comeback if given safety and time.</p>

<h3>What are some threats to the vaquita?</h3>

<p>Vaquitas are often caught in gillnets cast by illegal fishers. The habitat of the vaquita is protected by the government, yet illegal fishing boats are still caught there. Because the vaquita shares its habitat with the totoaba, which is also endangered, it is caught in the nets that are meant for the totoaba fish. Vaquitas have not been kept in captivity, due to the challenging attempts to keep them. Occasionally, the vaquita would die being kept in captivity.</p>

<h3>What would the effects on other creatures around it be if it went extinct?</h3>

<p>The vaquita feeds on small fish and squid, helping regulate how many of these creatures live in that environment. As well as being a predator, the vaquita is also prey to larger sea creatures, such as sharks and orcas. If the vaquita dies off, it could disrupt the predator-prey balance that is so delicate.</p>

<h3>What is being done to protect the vaquita?</h3>

<p>Currently, there are scientists trying to research the vaquita and make fishing safer for them. Also, there have been efforts to ban gillnets from the area and capture vaquitas to raise in captivity until their home was safe once more. One of the most important things a normal citizen can do is raise awareness or donate to these funds. Let’s all work together to save the vaquita!</p>

<h1>Project:Animals</h1>
<h4>Created by UnovaOshawott16</h4>
<p>My mission is to provide you with facts from reputable websites in one central place. Being in school used to make me think, "How come a single site doesn't have all the information I need?" My goal is to take away those questions and provide you with answers. If you have a question that has not been answered in the text provided, I will be working on a question and answer page. If something is brought to my attention that isn't in the text, I will gladly add it to it's respective page.</p>
